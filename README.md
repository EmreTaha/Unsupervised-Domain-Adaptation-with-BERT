# Unsupervised-Domain-Adaptation-with-BERT
A novel approach for BERT usage in unsupervised domain adaptation manner for a NLP tasks. The topic is **Unsupervised domain adaptation between two Amazon product reviews categories with BERT and a domain discriminator network for the sentiment analysis**.

Please cite original [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) paper when using the code.

The code based on BERT in the TF-Hub. `BERTOptimizer.py` file is modified for freezing the network partially. 

## Getting Started
Upload ipynb file, `BERTOptimizer.py`, `utils.py` files to Google Colab. The data (from Stanford) is downloaded and processed within the code

## Requirements
* Python 3.6
* pandas 
* Tensorflow 
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Scipy
* Google Colab
